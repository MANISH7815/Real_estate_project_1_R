# Real_estate_project_1_R
A real estate agency wanted to reduce the negotiation time and improve closure for buyers  and sellers of homes by ensuring that both sides were advised well on the potential sale/purchase price of  the home. To that end the agency wanted to predict a transaction price for all the houses in its market  which would be as close as possible to a price where the transaction would take place. Data regarding all  possible variables and qualities of over 10,000 houses sold in the past was collected and analyzed.
